Imgfloat is a real-time interactive OBS stream overlay. It allows channel administrators to display [images](./console/assets/images.md) and [videos](./console/assets/videos.md), play [audio](./console/assets/audio.md) and [anything else that you can code](./console/assets/scripts/overview.md) on the broadcast. Updates happen in real time so you can immediately see the changes on stream.

Want to get started? Checkout out the simple guide [as a broadcaster](./tutorial/broadcaster/overview.md) or [as a channel administrator](./tutorial/channel_admin/overview.md) or check out [https://imgflo.at](https://imgflo.at) to jump in right away.

Imgfloat is a free and open source project and you are free to host it yourself if you prefer. You can find the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/imgfloat).
