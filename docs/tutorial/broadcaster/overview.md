# Getting started as a broadcaster

Sign in with your Twitch account on [imgflo.at](https://imgflo.at) (or on your own instance) to register with the application.

Once signed in, you can add a channel administrator by entering their Twitch username. There is also a list of recommended channel administrators that you can add with a single click pulled from your Twitch moderator list.

If you just want to test things out, you can skip this step for now, as you have access to your own channel admin dashboard (if you decide to go this route it is recommended that you check out [Getting started as a channel admin](../channel_admin/overview.md)).

Finally, make sure to configure the canvas resolution to match your OBS settings. This ensures that the canvas covers the entire stream.

Now you're ready to download the client. The download link can be found on the index page or on your dashboard. Make sure you pick the right version for your operating system (currently Windows 10/11, MacOS (ARM) and GNU/Linux via appimage).

Once installed, simply enter your Twitch username in the client (optionally change the domain if using a self-hosted solution) and connect. This will create a transparent window with a title bar (assuming you didn't yet add any assets).

Now we're ready to add the window to OBS.
