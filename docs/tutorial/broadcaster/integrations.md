# Integrations

Your broadcast can be enchanced with various integrations that work seamlessly with Imgfloat. You can see the available integrations on the Imgfloat dashboard:

By enabling each integration you allow custom script assets to pull information from the respective service. Your channel administrators can use this information to create dynamic overlays that respond to events on your channel.

## Twitch emotes

Enabling Twitch emotes allows channel administrators to use global Twitch emotes as well as emotes specific for your channel, like those for subscribers.

## 7TV emotes

Enabling 7TV emotes allows channel administrators to use 7TV emotes, that you've enabled for your channel.

## Chat access

Enabling chat access allows channel administrators to create overlays that respond to chat messages, such as displaying recent messages or highlighting messages with specific keywords. It can also be used to trigger on demand events, like displaying a special animation when a viewer types a specific command.
