# Configuring OBS

To add the Imgfloat client window to OBS, start by opening OBS and adding a new source. Select "Window Capture" as the source type.

![Add window](./add_window.png)

Select the new window source and resize it to cover your scene completely. The window is configured to be exactly the size defined on your broadcast canvas, plus the window frame, so position the window frame just outside the visible area.

You can always test the setup by adding a simple image asset to the admin console and move it to each edge. The edges of the admin console should line up perfectly with the edges of your OBS scene.

That's it! You're now ready to use imgfloat. Next, check out the integrations available for your broadcast.
