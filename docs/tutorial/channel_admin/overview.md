# Getting started as a channel administrator

Sign in with your Twitch account on [imgflo.at](https://imgflo.at) (or on your own instance) to register with the application.

In order to modify the broadcast canvas for a specific broadcaster, you need to be added as a channel administrator by that broadcaster. Refer to the [Getting started as a broadcaster](../broadcaster/overview.md) guide for more information on how broadcasters can add you as an administrator.

Once added you can access the channel admin dashboard from the dashboard:

Assuming you're the first channel administrator the view will look something like this:

![Empty canvas](./empty_canvas.png)

Now you're ready to start adding assets to the canvas!
