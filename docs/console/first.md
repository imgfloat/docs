# Adding your first asset

To add your first asset to the broadcast canvas, click the "Add asset" button in the top left corner of the admin console.

Select 'Upload asset' and select an image file on your machine. Once uploaded, the asset will appear in the asset list on the left side of the admin console, as well as on the broadcast canvas on the right side.

You can now click and drag the asset on the canvas to reposition it. You can also use the handles around the asset to resize it. The position and size of the asset can also be adjusted more precisely using the controls in the asset details panel that appears when you select the asset in the asset list.

By default, assets are hidden. This is indicated on the left in the assets menu, and by displaying the asset transparently on the canvas. To make the asset visible in the broadcast, click the eye icon next to the asset in the asset list.

Let's try manipulating the asset a bit. Open the broadcaster view by clicking the "Broadcast view" button in the top bar in a new window. This view simulates what the broadcaster will see in their stream. Now, go back to the admin console and try moving and resizing the asset. You should see the changes reflected in real-time in the broadcaster view.

Let's now clean up the console. Select the asset in the asset list and press 'Delete', 'Backspace', or click the trash can icon in the asset details panel to remove the asset from the broadcast canvas.

Imgfloat supports a wide range of asset types. Let's learn about them in the next sections.
