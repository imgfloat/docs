# Image assets

Image assets are static images that can be added to the broadcast canvas. They support common image formats such as PNG and JPEG. For a full list of supported formats, refer to the [developer documentation for the Imgfloat server](https://github.com/imgfloat/server).

Image assets can be resized, repositioned, shown or hidden and rotated using the canvas controls or the asset details panel when selected. All updates of these kinds are instantly reflected in the broadcast view.

Image assets can be loaded by uploading a file using the 'Add asset' button and selecting a local file.

While GIF files are considered images traditionally, Imgfloat treats them as videos, as they are converted behind the scenes. This allows for better control over playback and performance. Refer to the [video assets](./videos.md) section for more information on how to use GIFs in Imgfloat.
