# Audio asssets

Audio assets are sound files that can be added to the broadcast. They support common audio formats such as MP3 and OGG. For a full list of supported formats, refer to the [developer documentation for the Imgfloat server](https://github.com/imgfloat/server)

Audio assets do not have a visual representation on the broadcast canvas, but they can be managed through the asset list on the left side of the admin console. Once added, audio assets can be played manually, or automatically loop by checking the "Loop" option in the asset details panel when selected.

In addition, the playback speed, pitch, volume and delay duration between loops can be controlled through the asset details panel.

If further customization is needed, consider using [a script asset](./scripts/overview.md) to control audio playback programmatically.
