# Reading chat

> **_NOTE:_**  Reading chat messages requires enabling the "Chat access" integration for your channel. Ask your broadcaster to enable this integration from the dashboard. For more information, refer to the [Integrations](../../../tutorial/broadcaster/integrations.md) guide.

Chat messages can be read using script assets. This allows for creating dynamic overlays that respond to chat activity, such as displaying recent messages or highlighting messages with specific keywords. It can also be used to trigger on-demand events, like displaying a special animation when a viewer types a specific command.
