# Admin console

The admin console is the control center for your Imgfloat broadcasts. From here, you can manage your asset live. The user interface is broken up into two distinct sections: the asset list on the left and the canvas view on the right. The canvas view on the right will display the layout that appears in the broadcast, while the asset list on the left allows you to manage and configure the individual assets that make up the broadcast.

If you prefer to see the actual interface that is shown to the broadcaster you can open the broadcast view with the "Broadcast view" in the top bar.

Let's start by adding our first asset.
